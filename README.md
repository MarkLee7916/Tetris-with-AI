# Tetris-with-AI
Rebuilding my Tetris Game in TypeScript, now with an AI <br>

<br>

Tooling: <br>
To get bundle.js I compiled my .ts files to .js files, and then bundled together using browserify <br>
I haven't included my package.json because the project has no dependencies

Controls: <br>
The keyboard arrows map onto movements (i.e left key arrow moves the tetrimono left etc) <br>
The 'h' key lets you hold tetriminos <br>

<br>

TODO:<br>
Add screen controls for mobile users<br>
Add help modal for controls<br>
Allow AI to hold pieces<br>
Fix formatting on phone (probably by removing the hold button)
